# UBER-Ride-Data-Wrangling-Analysis

## To Run:
  You need Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE to work on the codebase.

## Description:
Here we are working with the UBER ride sharing dataset of Victoria, Australia. </br>
We will load the given datasets:  </br>
 1.) dirty_data.csv, </br>
 2.) outliers.csv, </br>
 3.) missing_values.csv, </br> 
 4.) edges.csv, </br>
 5.) nodes.csv </br>
We will try to do some data wrangling &amp; EDA to find different types of errors (Syntactic/Semantic) and understand the data, also we will try to analyse and find outliers(if any) in all the dimensions and try some linear regression models to predict the missing values.
