# UBER-Ride-Data-Wrangling-Analysis

## Folder Structure:
  *'data' folder: * Which has 5 different data files with their specific usecases defined in the notebook. </br>
  *'dirty_data_solutions.csv' file: * This is a solution file for dirty data (which has semantic or syntactic errors) which has got the data after correction. </br>
  
  'outliers_solution.csv' file: This is a solution file for outlier data which has got the modified data after handling the outliers.
  'missing_value_solution' file: This is a solution file with imputed/ predicted values for missing data.
  
  'UBER_Data_Wrangling.ipynb' file: This is python notebook which can be opened in  Jupyter Notebook or any other platform which supports python notebook.
  
## To Run:
  You need Jupyter Notebook or any other IDE to work on the codebase.

## Description:
Here we are working with the UBER ride sharing dataset of Victoria, Australia. </br>
We will load the given datasets:  </br>
 1.) dirty_data.csv, </br>
 2.) outliers.csv, </br>
 3.) missing_values.csv, </br> 
 4.) edges.csv, </br>
 5.) nodes.csv </br>
We will try to do some data wrangling &amp; EDA to find different types of errors (Syntactic/Semantic) and understand the data, also we will try to analyse and find outliers(if any) in all the dimensions and try some linear regression models to predict the missing values.
